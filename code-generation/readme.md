this is a readme for hack machine Architicture

hack machines contain RAM, ROM, A register, D register
also there is M variable (will discuss later)

RAM is used to put values in

ROM is used for saving location of execution

(A) register is used to set values in, its the only way you can save values or constants directly
also When A is set, the memory location of the variable A will be selected, for ex. if A is 17 then
the RAM[17] will be selected, and the value of it can be fetched from the variable (M)
also writes to RAM can be by asssigning the value for variable (M)

D register is a variable register, where you can assing any value to this register and it will save it
